        ParagraphText="The ancient forms of the tanbur were probably close to the instruments from the same family that can be found today in the Near East. 
        The specificity of these instruments resides in the fact that their two strings are struck together with the fingers of the right hand, and not with a plectrum."

        This slight difference of pitch creates beating tones between the two strings.
