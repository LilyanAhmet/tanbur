               <span> the most important of which was the use of</span> five fingers of the right hand <span>called</span> “shor”, 
               <span> pressing down the low string with</span> the thumb of the left hand  
               <span> — but he also elevated this ancient musical traditionto a learned art form by</span> assembling a repertoire <span>of</span> over a 
               hundred pieces.<span> Ultimately, the profound impact of Ostad’s music reflects the embodiment of a lifelong pursuit of
